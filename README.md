# Random-Tutorials-Guides

Hello! This repository holds the collection of tutorials & guides that I've created in my journey of creating & maintaining a home server. This can range from Linux stuff to self-hosting services for my own use.

This repository *will* contain things that might seem very simple, and *definitely will* not be as organised as it could be, but as a self taught server administrator, I had to Google my way out of every issue I had, and this is my way of consolidating all the information I've learnt.
